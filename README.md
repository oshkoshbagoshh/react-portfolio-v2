# react-portfolio-v2

## Description
This is my portfolio page. It is a single page application that uses React components to render the page. It is a responsive design to make it mobile friendly. It is deployed on GitHub Pages. 

The goal for this project was to learn about the different React components and how building sepearte components can make it easier to build a page. I also learned about the different ways to style a page using React.

The main hurdle I faced when working on this project was deploying it to GitHub Pages. 

With more of the focus being on the React components, I did not spend as much time on the styling of the page. I would like to go back and add more styling to the page.
